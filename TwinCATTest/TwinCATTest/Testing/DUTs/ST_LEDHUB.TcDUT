    <Declaration><![CDATA[TYPE ST_LEDHUB :
STRUCT
	(*
		Need to include the following properties:
		- light has been switched on/off
		- light request has been sent over
		- write a variable using a time span(turn on the green light for an "x" amount of seconds, this value comes from an input in the HMI user interface(visualization, hopefully eventually web visualization)
		- log array, store change messages with time; perhaps a log structure, storing both time and message separately
		- current state of operation
		- value of light(this way, won't have to check for all 3 booleans, just need to check for this value right here)
